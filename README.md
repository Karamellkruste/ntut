### WeatherMap
It aims to create a dynamic dashboard that visually explores weather patterns across different locations. The core is an integrated visualization. When a user selects a city on the map, it updates a set of coordinated charts and line graphs for temperature trends over time. When a user clicks on a specific month, this triggers a radial chart to display a multi-dimensional climate profile and a gauge that indicates the humidity level.


### SmartSpace
It aims to create a real-time environmental monitoring dashboard that simulates drone-based air quality data collection. The platform integrates live data streaming through Firebase, transforming complex environmental metrics into intuitive visualizations for air quality assessment and monitoring.

It visualizes pollution levels across multiple dimensions: a radar chart displays comprehensive air quality indices, a line chart tracks temperature and humidity trends, a 3D bar chart enables comparative analysis, and an interactive 3D map shows spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentrations along simulated drone flight paths. 


### SmartSpaceWorkshop
It aims to create a unified IoT system for SmartSpace. It uses an ESP32 microcontroller to collect sensor data and control devices, relaying this information through a central Firebase cloud hub. It displays real-time sensor data as numbers, strings, and floats.
